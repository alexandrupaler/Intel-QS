To use this hacky interface:

Step 1: Compile InteQS using the instructions provided in the 
root directory.

The most important thing is to successfully compile the dynamic library 
`intelqs_py.cpython...` in `build/lib`. That will allow to use the IntelQS as
a simulator.

Step 2: In the conda environment required for the compilation of IntelQS run
`pip install cirq`

Step 3: An example of how to use the Intel simulator see 
`cirq_interface/main_test.py`.

Step 3_T: Test if the output includes all the gates from the circuit
`python cirq_interface/main_test.py | grep "_CXX_NO_CLUE_"`
 and if the grep does not find anything, this is a clue that a valid CPP could
 be generated.

Step 4: Write the generated experimental CPP into a file
`python cirq_interface/main_test.py > ../examples/google_cirq.cpp`

Step 5: Place `google_cirq.cpp` in the CMakeLists of examples, and then first
`cd build` followed by `make`.

*Note*: This should compile the translated circuit into a Intel-QS executable.
In this branch the Makefile is already edited, so warnings and errors like the 
following indicate that something is wrong with the generated file

```
